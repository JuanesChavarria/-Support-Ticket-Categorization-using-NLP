# Summary
This project aims to propose a solution to automate the categorization of support tickets received by a well known (reserved) company's service center in Colombia. Currently, the categorization is done manually by the requester or the call center team, resulting in a considerable amount of time spent on reassigning tickets. The proposed solution uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as text cleaning, tokenization, and supervised learning algorithms like KNN, support vector machine, logistic regression, and decision trees to classify the incoming tickets to their corresponding support area. The project builds upon the knowledge gained from the master's degree courses in data science, including information storage and retrieval, algebra for data science, and statistics in analytics, to provide a more efficient and accurate categorization system that reduces response times and allows for long-term data trend evaluation.
